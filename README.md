## 🔐 Password Security Vault

A secure password manager built in **Java**, featuring:

- **PBKDF2 (SHA-256 + Salt)** for master password hashing
- **AES-256 encryption** for protecting stored account passwords
- **Export/Import with passphrase encryption**
- **Built-in strong password generator**

This project demonstrates **Java security, encryption, and file handling** in a simple console-based application.

## 📂 Project Structure

    Password-Security-Vault/
    │── Main.java      # Entry point, handles user interface
    │── Auth.java      # Manages master password creation, verification & hashing
    │── Vault.java     # Encrypts, decrypts & manages account passwords
    │── vault.txt      # Encrypted password storage (auto-created, ignored in Git)
    │── vault.key      # AES encryption key (auto-generated, ignored in Git)
    │── master.key     # Stores master password hash + salt (ignored in Git)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Master password is hashed with **PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 + Salt** before storage.
- Account passwords are encrypted with **AES-256 (CBC + IV)** before saving to `vault.txt`.
- AES key is generated once and stored securely in `vault.key`.
- Exported vaults are encrypted with a **user-provided passphrase**.
- Sensitive files (`vault.txt`, `vault.key`, `master.key`) are **ignored in Git** using `.gitignore`.
- Even if `vault.txt` is opened, it only contains **Base64 ciphertext**.

## 📌 Roadmap / Future Enhancements

🔹 GUI-based version (JavaFX or Swing)  
🔹 Cloud sync with client-side encryption  
🔹 Password strength meter & breach check  
🔹 Cross-platform release (packaged JAR)  
🔹 Two-factor authentication (2FA) for master login
